# Grow/shrink selection

Plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that allows you to manipulate text
in a structural aware way.  

This plugin exposes the following commands, which can be mapped to keyboard shortcuts :
- `Stuctural Editing: Grow selection` 
- `Stuctural Editing: Shrink selection` 

## Implementation

The plugin converts the markdown into parse trees. At block level, it uses the
[mdast parser](https://unifiedjs.com/explore/package/mdast-util-from-markdown/).
The tree is post-processed to nest sections based on header levels.

Inside paragraphs text is parsed into an AST using a custom grammar. The parser
is generated by [Anltr4ts](https://github.com/tunnelvisionlabs/antlr4ts). The
resulting parse tree is then post-processed into an AST.

## Known issues

Trying to organize free text into a tree representation is not an exact
science. Many constructs are ambiguous, and trying to guess the next logical
block can be very subjective.

## TODO / wish-list

- Structural moving (eg. moving sentences, swapping sections, ...)

## Development

Please see the [Obsidian sample plugin](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin).
